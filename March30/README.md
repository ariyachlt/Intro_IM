## Description
For this assignment, we were asked to get information from at least one analog sensor and at least one digital sensor (a switch), and use this information to control at least two LEDs, one in a digital fashion and the other in an analog fashion, in some creative way. For my interactive piece, I drew inspiration from the high-striker game, a strength-tester attraction used at fairs, to create LEDs that flash in sequential order (in a normal state) at the rate of a fading LED at the top (I think it's much easier to understand what is going on from the Demo than to put in words). I decided to use the photoresistor as the analog sensor, the switch as the digital sensor, 4 green LEDs controlled in a digital manner, and 1 red LED controlled in an analog manner. The photoresistor controls the rate at which the green LEDs flash and the fading amount of the red LED so that they also match each other while the switch controls the flashing pattern of the green LEDs. Moving your hand closer to the photoresistor mimics the action of 'striking' the puck in the high striker game harder which makes the LEDs flash the pattern faster.

The photoresistor controls the speed of the green lights turn on and off and the LED fade amount (LEFT). The switch changes the pattern the green LED flashes (RIGHT). Click [here](https://youtu.be/mniN0i_mGFo) for a video demo.
