# Final Project Journal

## Preliminary Concept and Description (2-player car racing game)
For my final project, I want to create a two-player game involving some form of communication between Processing and Arduino. After some brainstorming, I settled on creating a two-player car racing game. Considering the type of game I created for my midterm project, I wanted to switch gears a little and create something that takes a little less brain power to play but still remains highly interactive. The competition between two players will probably make it more engaging as well.

**Game logistics**
The setup and goal of the game will be simple: try to get to the finish line before the other player. The cars will be side-by-side, with the finish line at the top of the screen (sketch below). I still haven't fully decided how I want to declare a winning condition but I am considering either doing a "best out of X rounds" or "first to reach X wins". This ensures that the game won't go on forever.
