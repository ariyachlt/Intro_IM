# Final Project Journal

## Preliminary Concept and Description (2-player car racing game)
For my final project, I want to create a two-player game involving some form of communication between Processing and Arduino. After some brainstorming, I settled on creating a two-player car racing game. Considering the type of game I created for my midterm project, I wanted to switch gears a little and create something that takes a little less brain power to play but still remains highly interactive. The competition between two players will probably make it more engaging as well.
