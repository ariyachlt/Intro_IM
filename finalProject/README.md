## Description
For my final project, I decided to create an adaptation of darts for two players. I call it Darts: Deconstructed. This idea came by quite unexpectedly as I was initially trying to create a two-player car racing game. However, it didn't work out and I ended up switching my idea quite last minute. Visit [journal.md](https://github.com/ariyachlt/Intro_IM/blob/main/finalProject/journal.md) for more details.

**What is Darts?** \
I assume that most already know what 'darts' or 'dart-throwing' is. But for those who don't or may not understand how it work, darts is a competitive sport where two or more players throw darts at a target (dartboard) and win by scoring exactly 0 points from the initial 501. Depending on where on the board the player hits, that amount of point gets subtracted from the player's current score. Bullseye scores 50, the outer ring scores 25 and a dart in the double or treble ring counts double or treble the segment score (image below). There are a few other versions of the game that I won't go into. The main take-away from this will be that players score a certion amount of points depending on where on the dartboard they hit.

**What does my version of it look like?** \
My version of the game is a little more simplified, with some odd adaptations here and there that I actually ended up quite liking the idea of because I was trying to reuse the functionality/interaction of my previous final project idea to create a different project. Below is list of how I adapted or 'deconstructed' the game. \

Things that stayed the same:


Things I modified:


I use the word 'deconstructed' to describe my project quite often because I view it as more than an adaptation. Rather than just changing components of the game here and there, I pull pieces of the game apart (including the actual hysical appearance of the board), and reconstruct it to make it fit what funtionality I already had before changing my idea from a two-player racing game to a two-player dart game.

## Process

## Schematic and Breadboarding
Below is a schematic of my circuit (left) and an image of how I breadboarded it (right). Since two players will be using switches on the same breadboard to control their 'dart', their placement is important. I made sure the switches were far apart from each other and that the wires were not in the way so that it can be comfortable for the players to control the switches.
