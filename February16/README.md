## Description
For this assignment, I decided to create a simple data visualization of mature miRNA sequences. These are short sequences of RNA that negatively regulate gene expression. As a biology major currently investigating the role of miRNAs in host susceptibility to malaria for my capstone, I thought it would be interesting to create a visualization for these sequences in a fun and creative way. I wanted my visualization to almost feel like art, while remaining informative for those who understand the biology of it. Therefore, I kept the visuals very simple. Each base (there are a total of 4: A, C, G, and U) is assigned a color (orange, yellow, light blue, and dark blue, respectively), and is displayed in rectangles of equal widths in sequential order. One miRNA is displayed at a time and a mouseclick randomizes the next miRNA to be displayed. The name, sequence length, and sequence of the miRNA is also printed in the processing console (example in the demo below). I chose not to print the names on the actual visuals because it takes away from the more 'artsy' feel that I wanted to create. I believe the data visualization still remains factual and representitive of the miRNA sequence even without the miRNA information (which can be accessed in the console if need be).
