## Description
For this assignment, we were asked to create an artwork or game using object-oriented programming. I chose to create art because it's just something that appeals to me more. I drew inspiration from an old project of mine on particle systems on p5.js ![(link here)](https://editor.p5js.org/ariyachlt/sketches/u24N-xgrC) with some alterations. In the p5.js version, the particles of various sizes starting at random positions move around the screen, reflecting off each other and the edges, and when in close enough proximity, a line is drawn connecting the particles. This new (and improved) particle system actually has no particles at all (at least none that are visible!). I chose to only use the "invisible" positions of the particles to direct my connecting lines to create the artwork. I also declard my background() in setup() instead of draw() so that it does not get refreshed every frame. This way the lines overlay ontop of each other. I also added another twist to randomize the color of the lines depending on the color of the first of the two "particles". Each time the demo is played, a new image is drawn because the initial positions of the particles are randomized. I have included an option to click to "refresh" the screen instead of having to close and replay it each time. I played around with a few color schemes and decided I liked the red tones more (left image) because I like to keep things simple. However, I still wanted to include how it looked when I completely randomize the colors (right image).
