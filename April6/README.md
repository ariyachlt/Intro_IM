## Description
The production assignment for this week was to make a musical instrument using at least one analog input and at least one digital input. My initial plan was to make some sort of Arduino version of a violin using 4 switches to represent the strings and a potentiometer to mimic when the pitch on a string changes based on where you press your fingers on the strings. However, I didn't like the feel of the potentiometer as it was quite hard to turn and felt very unstable on the breadboard, therefore, I switched it out for a photoresistor. Doing this produced sounds that reminded me of a Sci-Fi move so I decided to play into that idea. I ended up making an instrument that is a Sci-Fi movie soundtrack maker using a photoresistor, a buzzer, and four switches. I kept the default notes corresponding to each switch the same as the notes on the violin. It didn't matter too much what notes I chose as the photoresistor would distort it anyway, hence, the name of my instrument.
